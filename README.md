## Folders

### Contracts

Contains smart contract sources for various networks, grouped by the first two chars of the contract address.
Files are named in the format `<address>_<source_unit_name>`, e.g. `0f0c3fedb6226cd5a18826ce23bec92d18336a98_URToken.sol`

Some contracts are listed in `contracts.json`, but this file is not complete. Rely on the file structure for a full list. 
This repo used to auto submit contracts to [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/). Feel free to contribute sources.


### Utils

Scripts for dumping smart contracts from public sources (etherscan.io, etherchain.com)

**requires:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### Update

To use [List of Verified Contract addresses with an OpenSource license](https://etherscan.io/exportData?type=open-source-contract-codes), you can download the csv file, add it to the util folder, and run `parse_download_contracts_etherscan_io.py` (with your etherscan API). This will add the new contracts to the appropriate folder

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute smart contract sources, scripts for dumping sources or your analysis results with us.

### TODO

* dockerize 
* deduplication script (link instead of duplicate)
* statistics
* code-hash (without comments; maybe compile and hash bytecode to dedup sources)
